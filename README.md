Using **“SAMPLECode.R”**, you can try the method applied in this study. **“MS_INFO_PS.RData”** contains the PS stratification for PM2.5 monitors and sensors. **“SAMPLEdata.csv”** includes 75,000 observations randomly sampled from the original dataset, with a subset of predictors (a very few number of predictors) also randomly selected. The R script guides you through executing the algorithm we developed; however, note that the fitted model will not produce accurate results.
